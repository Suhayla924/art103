    <p> Our group member, Victoria went to Friday’s Laser-cut test session that was held on campus. Each of our group members created different fasteners designs to test out. Andrew created notch-based designs, Victoria created flat-based designs, Zhicheng created designs using the example template and I created tab and slot style designs.  We decided to create these different fasteners to plan what style our group would use for the final project. Andrew’s slotted design was cut in wood and acrylic and was the sturdiest out of all the connectors. Victoria’s flat designs were also cut in wood and acrylic and interlocked well with the exception of one design. The slot on Zhicheng’s designs was too narrow for the tab to fit in, but they were cut well. My designs were cut in plike and paper which was able to bend and fold together well. However, one of my designs was not able to print out entirely which made it hard for it to connect properly. It was good to do this test run to see what things need to be adjusted and taken into consideration in our designs for the final project.
