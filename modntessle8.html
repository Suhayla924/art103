        <h2>Phase 2: 3D Fastener BrainStorming Designs</h2>
        <h3>Suhayla's Desgins</h3>
        <p>The first one was made by cutting a slit on the ends of the design so that they can stick together.My second set of fasteners were made using a tab and fold method. In the design, I created a tab and cut a slit on each end of the shape.
          This way other parts can connect to the other end of the design by folding the tab into the slit of the other shape.</p>

        <p>Our group decided to divide the parts so that two people were creating fasteners using option A (Zhicheng and I), while the other two were using option B (Victoria and Andrew). We decided to create fasteners that would best suit the
          materials we were working with. Such as Zhicheng and I were using different types of papers as material to create our fasteners. So we ended up creating designs that had folds and cuts which are easy to create using paper. Zhicheng used an
          origami approach when assembling his fasteners, while I used a Kirigami method. Victoria and Andrew used different types of foam in their designs, so they ended up creating fasters that relied on static interlocking since the material is
          more sturdy and firm.
          I do think that the fasteners created in option B could be more suitable for our future project if we use a more solid material,such as wood or acrylic. The fasteners made in option A would suit a more flexible material. After creating
          these different fasteners it also leads a person to think about what a fastener could bring to an overall piece? Why would you want a piece to be modular or interlocking?</p>

        <h2>Phase 3: Goldilocks Laser Tests</h2>
            <p>Our group members, Victoria went to Friday’s Laser-cut test session that was held on campus. Each of our group members created different fasteners designs to test out. Andrew created notch-based designs, Victoria created flat-based
              designs, Zhicheng created designs using the example template and I created tab and slot style designs. We decided to create these different fasteners to plan what style our group would use for the final project. Andrew’s slotted design
              was cut in wood and acrylic and was the sturdiest out of all the connectors. Victoria’s flat designs were also cut in wood and acrylic and interlocked well with the exception of one design. The slot on Zhicheng’s designs was too narrow
              for the tab to fit in, but they were cut well. My designs were cut in plike and paper which was able to bend and fold together well. However, one of my designs was not able to print out entirely which made it hard for it to connect
              properly. It was good to do this test run to see what things need to be adjusted and taken into consideration in our designs for the final project.
